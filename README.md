### notes:

- I really liked the way that the walkers looked and moved across the screen so I decided to go with it.
- It reminded me of the way painting might be created, one stroke at a time and so I decided to code 3 sets of walkers to draw a randomised landscape.
- The first issue I ran into was not knowing how to reuse x and y coordinates for different walkers but with some trial and error i just labelled each value according to what aspect of the painting it would be working on.
- I wanted the clouds to form not only slower than the background, but take on more of a horizontal shape and thus I made their stroke small, decreased the step size, and also made the x axis of the step move faster than the y in order to create a more horizontal shape.
- One thing I really like about the landscape is that the addition of the clouds makes it ever changing. While the blue and green are limited to rather strict areas of the screen, the white is always being overrun by the blue and moving around as real clouds do.
- Halfway through working on it, I decided I didn’t want the painting to be limited to a 400 x 400 square, and adjusted some of the measurements in order to fill up one’s screen as a painting might.
